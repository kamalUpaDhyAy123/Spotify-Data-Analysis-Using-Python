## 📁 About the Project

Spotify is one of the world's largest audio streaming services. In this project:

- Cleaned and processed the Spotify dataset
- Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built visual insights using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Investigated audio features such as energy, loudness, acousticness, valence, and duration

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze correlation between audio features
- Identify patterns in song loudness, energy, and popularity
- Track song count trends over decades
- Compare song duration across genres and years
